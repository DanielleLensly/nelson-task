This project is a simple web app that lets users enter their name, email address, and a word. It validates the inputs to ensure the email is properly formatted and the word contains only letters. 

When submitted, the form sends the data to an API, which alphabetically sorts the letters of the word and returns a personalized response. 

The response displays the userâ€™s name, the email they entered, and the sorted version of their word in a styled message box.
