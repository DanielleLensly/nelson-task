I built a simple web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a serverless API deployed on Vercel. The front end contains a form that collects a user's name, email address, and a word. I implemented client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure the email is properly formatted (based on a recommended regex) and the word contains only alphabetic characters. Once validated, the data is sent via a POST request to an API endpoint (/api/sorter). The API, written in JavaScript, receives the data, converts the word to lowercase, alphabetically sorts its letters, and returns a JSON response. The front end then displays a friendly, personalized message with the original email and the sorted word.
